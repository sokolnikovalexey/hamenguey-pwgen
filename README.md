This is simple password generator based on Hamenguey's "The Old man and the Sea".
The main idea is to create the password than you can keep in your mind.

##Alg
1. Get some random words from the book "The Old man and the Sea"
2. Replace all consonant with random consonant
3. Replace all vowels with random wowels
4. ???
5. PROFIT!

- Stop! But we can just generate random string and use it like a password!
- No! The main thing is the order of the letters in the word. It helps you to remember the world. It makes new generated word readable.
